A simple snake game that I made for fun

## Features

Has score, audio, and some color

## How to play

Self-explanatory; WASD to move. Eating apples makes snake longer and increases score. Hitting walls and the snake tail restarts the game. 

## Features to add

* Arrow Keys
* Change the atrocious color scheme
* Add a move queue to make smooooooth
