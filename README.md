A simple snake game that I made for fun

Has score, audio, and some color

#### How to play

Pretty self-explanatory but: 
* WASD to move
* Eating apples makes snake longer and increases score
* Hitting walls or the snake tail restarts the game 

#### Features to add

* Arrow Keys
* Change the atrocious color scheme
* Add a move queue to make smooooooth
