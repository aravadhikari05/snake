#### Features

* Score
* Audio (plinggg)
* Grid
* Colors

####Running
\* You must have JRE 1.8 or newer to run. Second option will only work if you have your java path set.

Either:
* Double click the snake.jar file
or
* cd to where the file is located and run:
`java -jar snake.jar`

#### How to play

Pretty self-explanatory but: 
* WASD to move
* Eating apples makes snake longer and increases score
* Hitting walls or the snake tail restarts the game 

#### Features to add

* Arrow Keys
* Change the atrocious color scheme
* Fix the bad text quality from running using jar file
* Add a move queue to make smooooooth
